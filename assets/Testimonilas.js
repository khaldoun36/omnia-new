Sam has educated me on food, the science behind up and down days with weight and training techniques. He would video himself with explanation. Then I would video my session and send it to him. He would correct me if I wasn't executing it correctly. Even though Sam and I live in different country",

I lost 2 and a half stone in total, I've tried many PT's over the years but never made any real progress till met Sam, He literally changed my life.",
